Using machine learning to predict the stock prices of Tesla stock.

We chose to solve this problem by using a regression algorithm. Regression algorithm is a statical analysis used to model and generate an analysis of the relationship between stock prices change and time. This algorithm examines the historical price data of TSLA to generate a prediction of future prices. 
In this problem, we are examining stock data, this is perfect since we are focusing on something that changes numerically over time. This type of algorithm is also used in various fields, typically related to things such as temperatures, sales volume, financial and even in medical diagnosis where it can use data such as test results and medical history to predict the further development of sickness and more.
