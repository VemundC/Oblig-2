Using machine learning to predict the stock prices of Tesla stock

We chose to solve this problem by using linear regression algorithm, because of how regression algorithms is used when the output is continuous and numerical. In this problem, we are examining stock data, this is perfect since we are looking at something that changes numerically over time. this type of algorithm is also typically used when predicting things such as temperatures, sales volume, stock prices and even in medical diagnosis where it can use data such as test results and medical history to predict the further development of sickness and more.
